### SmartBillProject

#### Background Information: this project is made in 20 days and that was after taking a strong education in TÖDEB Bootcamp in .Net Technology with our great teacher Mr.Murat Kurtboğan who has experience in this field for around 9 years. It was about 7 weeks full of information and energy with a fantastic group in a very collaborative environment.

In Addition, the main topics that we worked on them in those weeks were:

#### Background Information about this project: my project is built using the best practice of each strategy used. It is a website that helps people with managing their bills by being a connection between customers and admins. Admins create and assign bills to customers, then customers get their bills and pay them with many features.

### In the Smart Bill documentation that I have added you see the detail, I will show and explain my project step by step, so have a nice time :)
